# Sindoh 3DWOX Printer Safety

1) The inside of the machine may be hot. To reduce the risk of injury from a hot component, allow some time to cool down.(Please be cautious of getting burns during printing as the Nozzle and the heating bed will maintain a high temperature of over 100 degrees.)
2) Do not put any portion of your body or objects on any part during machine operation as the motor and
 bed can be in very high temperature and can cause burns/injuries. Please be cautious.
3)  When the power is on, do not let any of your body touch the machine except the bed.If you have to touch the bed while the power is on, please do so after the bed temperature has been lowered to room temperature.
4) If you have to touch any parts other than the bed, please do so after the bed and nozzle temperature have been lowered to room temperature
